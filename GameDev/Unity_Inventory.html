            <br>create scriptable objects and inventory system
            <br>add objects via unity editor
            <br>the core idea is to have item inherit from scriptable object
            <br>and have an Enum to hold item type
            <br>then set up the objects' properties in the edito
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>for inventory itself, also create as scriptable object
            <br>so later on could create different inventory for player, or shop, or tutorial
            <br> the inventory class is holding inventory slots
            <br> and then , the slots are holding items and their quantity
            <br>
            <br>    
            <br> The display part is using a dictionary to hold
            <br> the itemslot and it's item 
            <br> it also us RectTransform to set up the positon of each item slot
