        <ol>
            <br>DoTween Library is really cool
            <br> it could control transform movement, rotate, scale, color, alpha,
            <br> in a very simple way
            <br> and camera shake
            <br> also it could expose number value to affect other system 
            <br> another similar library is called LeanTween, also tried a bit 
            <br> but it seems more useful in UI 
            <br> bought the DoTween pro version, will test more features later
