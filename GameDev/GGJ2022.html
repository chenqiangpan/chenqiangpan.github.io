            <li>Idea and design of the game: </br>
                you control two players; </br>
                the goal is to let them meet; </br>
                they have same movement in the beginning; </br>
                if one of them touch the boundary, it would die;</br>
                after it dies, it would respawn;</br>
                whenever a player enter into a same color zone, it's control would be reversed</li>
            <li>Art style, I mean, black and white </li>
            <li>create simple movement mechanic</li>
            <li>reverse the control when the white player enter into white area</li>
          </ol>
