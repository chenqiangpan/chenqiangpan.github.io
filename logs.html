    <p>
      Day1 (2022/01/19): 在github pages上创建了一个repo; 用aws
    </br> route53申请了一个域名，并且用CNAME record指向git的io页面；
</br> 试着安装Jekyll但是失败了，它的安装前提需要另外四个软件，Ruby, RubyGems,
</br> GCC, Make，后面两个不知道怎么安装； 随便写了一些JS代码。
    </p>

    <p>
      Day2 (2022/01/20): build a sample Unity project into WEBGL and then
    </br>uploaded to the site; known issue: If I build the webgl version with
</br>compress, then I need do some setting on the web server site, otherwise,
</br>the unity content won't load; compare: compressed: 4MB, un compressed: 14
      MB
    </p>

    <p>
      Day3 (2022/01/21): Interesing, seems if I add this in to .html file I have
    </br>JQuery ready to use, Goolge is the CDN of JQuery: explored something about
</br> css position, and with hide/show function in JQuery
    </p>

    <p>
      Day4 (2022/01/22): follow React's tutorial, made a Tic Tac Toe game then
    </br>build and deploy the react project to a git repo then download the
</br>reop...and copy to this main project I am sure this is not the best way to
      do it...
    </p>

    <p>
      Day5 (2022/01/23): tried a little bit Vue, very powerful JS frontend stuff
    </br> I have tried both the old way and new way to toggle a shape's Color In the
</br> old way, it has a method inside Vue, to create a toggle function there In
</br> the new way, it only has one data show: true, there, a bool, apparently
</br>  Then, in the html, it is using v-on:click = "show =!show" to do the basic
</br>  logic and then, it is using a v-if, and a v-else to call different
</br>  components to render them , very cool. Then there is anotherway to change
</br>   color, which is pick up a color and apply to the inline css style, by
</br>   using v-bind: style I think to switch color, the third way is the right
</br>   way, we don't really need to create a component to do color switch also, I
</br>   could embed the -webkit-transition into inline css to have vue's
</br>   transition things...cool beans
