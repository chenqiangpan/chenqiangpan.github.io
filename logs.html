        Day1 (2022/01/19): 在github pages上创建了一个repo; 用aws route53申请了一个域名，并且用CNAME record指向git的io页面；
        试着安装Jekyll但是失败了，它的安装前提需要另外四个软件，Ruby, RubyGems, GCC, Make，后面两个不知道怎么安装；
        随便写了一些JS代码。
    </p>

    <p>
        Day2 (2022/01/20): build a sample Unity project into WEBGL and then uploaded to the site; known issue:
        If I build the webgl version with compress, then I need do some setting on the web server site, otherwise, the unity content won't load;
        compare: compressed: 4MB, un compressed: 14 MB
    </p>

        Day3 (2022/01/21):

        Interesing, seems if I add this in to .html file I have JQuery ready to use, Goolge is the CDN of JQuery:

        Day4 (2022/01/22):

        follow React's tutorial, made a Tic Tac Toe game
        then build and deploy the react project to a git repo
        then download the reop...and copy to this main project
        I am sure this is not the best way to do it...

    </p>

    <p>
        Day5 (2022/01/23):

        tried a little bit Vue, very powerful JS frontend stuff
        I have tried both the old way and new way to toggle a shape's Color
        In the old way, it has a method inside Vue, to create a toggle function there
        In the new way, it only has one data show: true, there, a bool, apparently
        Then, in the html, it is using v-on:click = "show =!show" to do the basic logic
        and then, it is using a v-if, and a v-else to call different components to render them , very cool.

        Then there is anotherway to change color, which is pick up a color and apply to the inline css style,
        by using v-bind: style

        I think to switch color, the third way is the right way, we don't really need to create a component to 
        do color switch

        also, I could embed the -webkit-transition into inline css to have vue's transition things...cool beans


    </p>

    <p>
        Day6 (2022/01/24):

       use webstorage to store user input and read it 
       use Vue to store and pass the data to DOM


    </p>


    <p>
        Day7 (2022/01/25):
        javascript + Vue
       create two simple progress bar
       first one could reflect current year progression by getting the Date()
       second one could record personal year Goal
       also using web storage to record the goal and update it in the progress bar


    </p>

    <p>
        Day8 (2022/01/26):
        Bootstrap + CSS animation
        using bootstrap spinners + CSS animation create something...very strange
        also using Bootstrap navbar and shadow for the top banners

    </p>

    <p>
        Day9 (2022/01/27):
        a simple todo list from Vue offical website

        and a check box in the template of the <li></li> 

    </p>

    <p>
        Day10 (2022/01/28):
